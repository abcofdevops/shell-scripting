# Variables
Variables are used to store data that can be used later in the script. In this example, we will use variables to store a word and a character.
And then we have used these variables in the command later.

## Objective
- Storing changeable values in variables


## Types of variables:
- **String**: A sequence of characters, e.g., "hello".
- **Integer**: A whole number, e.g., 42.
- **Float**: A number with a decimal point, e.g., 3.14
- **Array**: A collection of items, e.g., `("apple" "banana" "cherry")`.
- **Boolean**: Represents true or false values, e.g., `true` or `false`.
