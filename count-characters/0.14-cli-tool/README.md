# Creating a CLI Tool
This step finalizes the script as a reusable CLI utility.

## Objective
- Make your script globally accessible from any terminal.
- Rename it to a friendly CLI name like `countchar`.


## Usage
1. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x countchar
```

2. Move it to a system path:
```bash
sudo mv countchar /usr/local/bin/
```

3. Run it from anywhere:
```bash
countchar hello l
```

>## CLI Tool
>Copy 'countchar' to /usr/local/bin to use globally.


## Concepts

- `chmod +x`: Make script executable
- Global CLI tool setup
